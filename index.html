                        After many years of working by the scientists, they have developed a new technology based in a
                        drop of blood
                        that allows to determinate many offspring and probability in socioeconomics status.

                        Cercidoideae, one of the six subfamilies of Leguminosae, contains one genus Cercis with its
                        chromosome number 2n = 14 and all other genera with 2n = 28. An allotetraploid origin hypothesis
                        for the common ancestor of non-Cercis genera in this subfamily has been proposed; however, no
                        chromosome-level genomes from Cercidoideae have been available to test this hypothesis. Here, we
                        conducted a chromosome-level genome assembly of Bauhinia variegata to test this hypothesis. The
                        assembled genome is 326.4 Mb with the scaffold N50 of 22.1 Mb and contains 37,996 protein-coding
                        genes. The Ks distribution between gene pairs in the syntenic regions indicates two whole-genome
                        duplications (WGDs): one is B. variegata-specific, and the other is shared among core eudicots.
                        Although Ks between gene pairs generated by the recent WGD in Bauhinia is greater than that
                        between Bauhinia and Cercis, the WGD was not detected in Cercis, which can be explained by an
                        accelerated evolutionary rate in Bauhinia after divergence from Cercis. Ks distribution and
                        phylogenetic analysis for gene pairs generated by the recent WGD in Bauhinia and their
                        corresponding orthologs in Cercis support the allopolyploidy origin hypothesis of Bauhinia. The
                        genome of B. variegata also provides a genomic resource for dissecting genetic basis of its
                        ornamental traits.
